## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>

1. Which genre's perform the most? </br>
2. Which Platform is being used by the most by the users, PS4 or Xbox? </br>
3. How does a games platform, Genre, critic score, user score, and Rating influence sales. Can we predict
Sales using these attributes? </br>

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://dev.to/ankit1797/xbox-vs-ps4-which-is-the-best-gaming-platform-based-on-data-55pb)
